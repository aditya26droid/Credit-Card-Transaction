# Credit-Card-Transaction
We used Random Forest classifier for classification of transaction whether it is fraud or not. We can see there was huge class imbalance between fraud and not fraud transaction so we have to balance it . We got an accuracy of 97.53 and by reducing model complexity we got 96.92
